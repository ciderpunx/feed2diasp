       Edit feed2diasp.json to set up your account details then just:

       $ feed2diasp.pl

       You probably want to run this as a cronjob

       Install by untarring with

       $ tar xvzf feed2diasp.tar.gz

       Then

       $ cd feed2diasp

       You'll need to make sure you have Perl 5.10.0 and the CPAN
       dependencies.

       $ sudo cpan XML::Feed Readonly HTML::Strip Data::Dumper WWW::Mechanize

       Then copy the example config file and edit it to something more to your
       taste.

       $ cp feed2diasp.json.example feed2diasp.json

       You should make feed2diasp.pl executable wiith

       $ chmod 750 feed2diasp.pl

       Finally you can start updating your feed with

       $ ./feed2diasp.pl

       You may want to put that in a cron job.

       All options are set in feed2yaml.json . I used JSON rather than YAML to
       reduce dependencies
